The person with dementia uses a coaster stand that includes a set of coasters, a digital screen, and a microphone. When a coaster is removed, the screen begins to play instructions, and when a drink is placed on the coaster, the message from the family begins to play. A response can be recorded immediately and sent back to the family.",

When approaching each other, the particles become warmer in color; when approaching each other very closely, the avatars' particles are attracted to each other. A flute-like sound gets louder as one gets closer, building tension in a kind of harmonic dissonance. When the avatars touch each other, a small firework is emitted, accompanied by a \"ping\" sound. The avatar has a cloud-like heart oscillating in size and color with each heartbeat, when both persons touch each other near the heart they hear the other's heartbeat.",

Wearing ParChiCo, the parent can initiate contact by waving, which results in a light on the bunny's paw. By pressing a button, the child can make ChiParCo re-enact the wave, automatically notifying the parent of the re-enactment through a color change. By holding the gloved paw, the child can initiate a handhold, which triggers a vibration in the parent's glove. Turning the palm upward causes the bunny's left paw to rise, inviting the child to hold it. When both interact simultaneously, the rabbit's paw warms and vibrates, and the glove warms and contracts. In addition, the child can communicate emotions by pressing a colored emoji.",
