short_description = "The intelligent, NLP- and recommendation-based Spatial Hypertext system promotes emotional closeness through storytelling. Information is gathered from the playfully created visual structures of family members' thoughts and remembrance artifacts. Emotions derived from speech, facial expressions, gestures, or physiological measurements prompt the user to suggest additions to the memory space. In this way, the family collaboratively builds a spatial hypertext of family stories."
