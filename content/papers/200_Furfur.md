short_description = "Furfur is a robotic pet for couples in LDR to create feelings of closeness and togetherness. It can be summoned by knocking on the lid of the closed box, but it will only appear if the other Furfur is in its box (as if it were a single entity). The pet picks up sounds from the environment, transforms them, and reproduces them when interacting."
