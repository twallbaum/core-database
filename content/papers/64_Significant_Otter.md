short_description = "Significant Otter is an app for Apple Watch and iPhone that allows romantic partners to share and respond to each other's biosignals. Each person has an animated otter that reflects their inner state, which can be sent to their partner. The app suggests sharing pre-defined emotions (based on heart rate) and activities (based on time, movement, or heart rate), greetings, and affection."
