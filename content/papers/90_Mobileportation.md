short_description = "Mobileportation is a mobile phone-based telepresence prototype that provides an immersive experience. It creates a 3D reconstruction of the local person's environment that can be explored by the remote person in an exocentric view. Both partners' faces are displayed in the shared environment, enabling face-to-face communication."
