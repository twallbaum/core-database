short_description = "sleepyWhispers is a device for long-distance couples to exchange goodnight messages, consisting of a pillow with a hidden speaker inside and a photo frame. Partners can use any device to record an audio message that the remote partner can listen to with their head on the pillow. It is started by pressing a button on an accompanying photo frame. Each message can be listened to only once, but can be downloaded while listening."
