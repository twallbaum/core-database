short_description = "ChiParCo is an interactive plush bunny for children, ParChiCo is an interactive glove for parents. It allows waving, holding hands and sharing emotions. Wearing ParChiCo, the parent can initiate contact by waving, which results in a light on the bunny's paw. By pressing a button, the child can make ChiParCo re-enact the wave, automatically notifying the parent of the re-enactment through a color change. By holding the gloved paw, the child can initiate a handhold, which triggers a vibration in the parent's glove. Turning the palm upward causes the bunny's left paw to rise, inviting the child to hold it. When both interact simultaneously, the rabbit's paw warms and vibrates, and the glove warms and contracts. In addition, the child can communicate emotions by pressing a colored emoji."
