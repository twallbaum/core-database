short_description = "Forget Me Not is an ambient display in the form of two paired flowers designed to increase communication between partners. The flower represents the health of a couple's relationship: when it is upright and 'alive', the partners are communicating frequently, and it droops with the length of the communication gap (based on their call data history). In addition, a partner can actively indicate that they need more attention, which causes the flower to actively droop and change color to red."
