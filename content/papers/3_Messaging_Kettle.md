short_description = "The Messaging Kettle augments the everyday kettles of two households. It is composed of the Kettle Mate and the Smart Tea Box. The Kettle Mate is equipped with a temperature sensor and paired with the existing kettle. Upon detecting heat from its kettle, the Kettle Mate sends a signal to its counterpart in the other kitchen, which then produces an animated glow for ten minutes. It also allows to exchange voice messages. Additionally, the Smart Tea Box permits the exchange of brief, handwritten messages or sketches via a stylus pen."
