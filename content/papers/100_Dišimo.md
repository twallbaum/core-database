short_description = "Dišimo is a portable, multimodal ambient display that raises awareness of a person's inner state by providing feedback on stress levels assessed through heart rate monitoring. When it detects low heart rate variability over time, it plays an audio track to set the pace for regular and deep breathing, which also activates the devices of close ones to join in a shared relaxation session."
