short_description = "Connecting Through Housework is a robotic vacuum cleaner that operates in the home only when a mobile totem device moves, so the robot's behavior reflects the routines of the distant family member. In addition, touching the totem causes the robot's light to brighten, shaking it causes the robot to rotate, and tapping it stops the robot."
