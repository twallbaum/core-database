short_description = "PV-Pix are displays constructed of tangible and deformable photovoltaic elements, either in a window frame or as curtains, connecting two homes of slum residents providing an inclusive and alternative way to communicate between homes. Each PV-Pix element consists of a deformable energy harvesting material that, when actuated by a person in one home, changes its physical state both there and in a connected home."
