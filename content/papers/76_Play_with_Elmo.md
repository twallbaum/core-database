short_description = "Play With Elmo is a synchronous messaging system for preschool children, built around a jack-in-the-box toy with a embedded mobile phone that allows children to record and share video messages. When the phone is inserted and pressed, it begins to play a song. Then it pops up with a pre-recorded, composited video of the distant adult and Elmo playing together, inviting the child to play along."
