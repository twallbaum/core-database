short_description = "Skin Hunger is a web-based interactive system for a telematic installation in which people can interact with each other through embodied joint music making and movement over a distance. A browser-based machine learning technology recognizes participants' skeletons in webcam videos. When they visually touch or overlap, the movements result in musical outcomes. "
