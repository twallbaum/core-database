short_description = "The ABRA (Affect and Behavior-Related Assistance) system enables easy communication between generations and enables unobtrusive recognition and response to relevant states of older adults. It consists of components for sensor-based assessment of a person's mental and physical state, for reasoning about an appropriate response, and for communication and interaction. Real-time information about the older adult is continuously available to selected people on a web page; conversely, family members can post pictures or trigger text messages on a picture frame."
