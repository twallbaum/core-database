short_description = "Fyro is a set of two connected candleholders that is inspired by the symbolic ritual of lighting a candle when thinking of loved ones. Two connected candleholders sit atop a box with a heart-shaped light. When a user lights a candle, the status update is detected by a sensor and sent to the connected Fyro, causing the heart-shaped light to stay on until the candle is blown out."
