short_description = "The e-Seesaw is a simple, tangible device that allows parents and children to play remotely by pushing down on the e-Seesaw, causing the other e-Seesaw to mirror the movement. Children can request parental attention, and both partners can send each other 'I'm thinking of you' messages."
