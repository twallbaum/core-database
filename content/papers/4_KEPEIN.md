short_description = "KEPEIN is an interface in the form of a coffee maker to enhance remote communication while sharing a cup of coffee over a distance. It consists of a mug and a coffee maker. When the mug is shaken, it seeks to connect to the paired mug, which is indicated by vibration and a blinking light. Picking up the mug initiates an audio connection, and both can use their cups to convey messages each time they drink. Flipping the mug ends the communication."
