name = "ETC (Embodied Telepresent Connection)"
short_description = "ETC allows two people to interact remotely through pseudo-haptic touch via their abstract aura avatars, which consist of confetti-like particles that are continuously generated over the surface of the body. The pseudo-haptic elements are also abstract and responsive to proximity. When approaching each other, the particles become warmer in color; when approaching each other very closely, the avatars' particles are attracted to each other. A flute-like sound gets louder as one gets closer, building tension in a kind of harmonic dissonance. When the avatars touch each other, a small firework is emitted, accompanied by a \"ping\" sound. The avatar has a cloud-like heart oscillating in size and color with each heartbeat, when both persons touch each other near the heart they hear the other's heartbeat."
