short_description = "Forget Me Not is a pair of interconnected artificial flowers designed to support communication between family members and friends of seriously ill patients. The glow of the flowers indicates the activity of the person. By touching the leaf, one can express the desire to talk (by phone, etc.), removing the flower indicates the need for privacy, which is a specific need of patients suffering from a serious illness."
