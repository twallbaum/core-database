short_description = "Bear-With-Me is a cuddly toy that allows remote couples to exchange hugs in real time. When one partner hugs their bear, the physical hug is sent to the other bear and a red heart-shaped light begins to glow. The other person can respond with a hug or pat, which turns off the red light and lights up the other bear's LED. Bears also share when they are moved or played with, and their feet begin to glow."
