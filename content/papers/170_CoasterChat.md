short_description = "CoasterChat embeds asynchronous digital communication into a daily coffee routine to support social exchange between people with early-stage dementia and their family. The family's artifact is a rotating coaster connected to a mobile application; lights remind them to send new messages. The person with dementia uses a coaster stand that includes a set of coasters, a digital screen, and a microphone. When a coaster is removed, the screen begins to play instructions, and when a drink is placed on the coaster, the message from the family begins to play. A response can be recorded immediately and sent back to the family."
