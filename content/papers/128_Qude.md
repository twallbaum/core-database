short_description = "Qude is a vibro-tactile wearable for long-distance couples to tap and send a rhythm to their partner. It can be applied like a patch to different parts of the body. Using the app, they can assign meanings to the rhythms, which are linked to emoticons displayed in the smartphone application, and over time develop an exclusive tactile code."
