name = "Bendi"
short_description = "Bendi is a shape-changing add-on for smartphones allowing haptic and visual interactions through shape-changing movements during phone conversations. Using the joystick results in shape-changing movements, such as up- or downward bending, left or right tilting, and shrinking by of the other partner's device in real time. The smartphone is held in front (not at the cheek), so that one can not only feel but see the movement."
