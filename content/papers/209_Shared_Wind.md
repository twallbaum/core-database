short_description = "Shared Wind is a nature-based design system for subtle emotional communication between long-distance couples. It consists of a miniature fan, wind chime, light curtain and smart plugs. When there is a natural wind blowing the local partner's curtain, he or she can forward the signal and then the receiver's curtain would be blown up (on the closed window side)."
