short_description = "Touch Trace Mirror is a mirror that allows partners to leave a message on a steamy bathroom mirror over distance. Writing a message on one mirror leads to the message being sent to the partner's mirror, indicated by a light appearing on the mirror surface. When a finger is placed on the light, the light begins to move so that the partner can trace the message."
