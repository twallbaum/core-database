short_description = "EmbER (Embodied Experience Remotely) is a wearable that subtly augments conventional video calls with feedback from biosignals such as breathing and heartbeat. Heart rate is communicated through haptic feedback via a wearable wristband, and respiration rate is conveyed through an audio channel that plays Bronian noise with a sinusoidal amplitude envelope. It can be used with standard headphones or a smartwatch equipped with a vibration motor and heart rate sensor."
