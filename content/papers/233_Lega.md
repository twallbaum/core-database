name = "Lega"
short_description = "Lega is a mobile, tangible device for situated, bodily expressive sharing of experiences within an art exhibition among a small group of friends. It is touch-, motion-, and location-sensitive, resulting in vibration patterns on the belly of a Lega that are tied to a specific location within the art exhibition. These patterns reflect actions, e.g. a strong shake would result in a strong vibration, tickling would result in a tickling sensation."
