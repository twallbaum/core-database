short_description = "Mini Robot Gestures allows people to send and receive emotional signals using a pair of small robots. Each robot represents the other person. Through the app it is possible to send one of six predefined emotions, and the robot will act it out for the person by making a certain movement (e.g., sadness-slow circles, happiness-medium circles)."
