short_description = "TaSST (Tactile Sleeve for Social Touch) allows two people to communicate by touch over distance. A smart textile sleeve consisting of an input layer and an output layer is worn on the forearm. Touching the outer input layer of one sleeve is felt as a vibration in the output layer directly on the skin of the other person's sleeve."
